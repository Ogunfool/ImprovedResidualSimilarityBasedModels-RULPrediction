# Residual Similarity Based Models
This repo contains systematically organized notebooks of different residual similarity based models for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. 
These models were validated on the FD002 NASA turboengine degradation dataset.
The notebooks are structured in a sequential and incremental order with enough comments to provide a seamless flow for anyone interested in using it.
This repo is still in progress but feel free to draw ideas from it - Kindly cite this repo if this work is used anywhere.
